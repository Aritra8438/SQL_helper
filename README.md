# SQL_helper
This repository contains a demo database and some of the most used commands. (MySQL only)
--
The database is originally taken from [Ben's](https://github.com/bbrumm) one of the top repositories, [databasestar](https://github.com/bbrumm/databasestar). I have modified it a little. First 8 files are to create the database.

while following [Lakshay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lakshayk12/) bhaiya's SQL video, I managed to compile most of the commands. All the commnads are tested and explained a little bit. Those are in 9th file.

How to use:-
--
If anyone wants to follow the same, you can use this as a helper repository. <br/>
Copy the HTTPS code of the repository and run `git clone <copied_code>` at the required directory. <br/>
Now open your **SQL client software application**, set an active connection and run those files in order upto 8th one. <br/>
You may create the database first (Sometimes, it's required). Don't worry, these codes will work fine (as `DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS` will be executed first).<br/>
9th file contains all the commands stated in the videos. Run them as the course goes on.
